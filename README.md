Implementation of a simple image segmentation algorithm of a natural scene image by taking its Laplacian of Gaussian in frequency domain and converting it back to time domain to get a spatially-enhanced image.

Next applying K-means clustering algorithm with n=2 to separate out text and background of the image.

[**collage.png**] show the transformtation of the iamge. 

Run the [**text_clustering.py**] file on any natural scene image with text in it to generate the text and non-text clusters for it.
